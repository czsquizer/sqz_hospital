# SQZ_HOSPITAL SCRIPT

Simple script for healing in hospital when there are no free medics on the server. You simply check in in the reception, then you take your free bed, wait until the doctor (Local NPC) makes all the operations, then if you have money you will get healed, if not, eh, unlucky.

# Features
- Heal when there are no doctors on the server

- Leave bed in progress and don't get healed

# Instalation
- Drop the script into your resources folder and start it in your `server.cfg`

- Yes, thats actually all

### You can edit this script as yours, but do NOT take it as yours, republish it, resell it as Mr. Cryzysek (ProjectX server owner) did it with sqz_switchjob.

I used animations from this script: https://github.com/Quostix/mythic_hospital, so you can check it out.
