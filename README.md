# SQZ_HOSPITAL SCRIPT

Simple script for healing in hospital when there are no free medics on the server. You simply check in in the reception, then you take your free bed, wait until the doctor (Local NPC) makes all the operations, then if you have money you will get healed, if not, eh, unlucky.

### You can edit this script as yours, but do NOT take it as yours, republish it, resell it as Mr. Cryzysek (ProjectX server owner) did it with sqz_switchjob.

I used animations from this script: https://github.com/Quostix/mythic_hospital, so you can check it out.
